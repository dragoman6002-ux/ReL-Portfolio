# Case Study: NFT Marketplace + Creator Platform

**Client Type:** NFT marketplace  
**Scale:** Top 10 by volume, 5M+ users  
**Platforms:** 2 (marketplace, creator tools)  
**Engagement:** 30 days, $85K  
**Date:** Q3 2024 *(anonymized)*

---

## Problem

Client operated two separate platforms:
1. **Marketplace:** Buy/sell/trade NFTs
2. **Creator Tools:** Mint, manage, and launch collections

**Issue reported:** "We think creators are using our minting tools but selling on other marketplaces to avoid fees."

**Reality:** Worse—organized bot networks exploiting the gap.

---

## Findings

### Finding 1: Fee Avoidance Network

**Pattern:**
- Creators mint on Client's tools (subsidized, low-cost)
- List and sell on competitor marketplaces (no fees to client)
- Client bears minting infrastructure costs but captures no transaction fees

**Volume:**
- 12,400 creators identified using this pattern
- $42M in sales volume (external marketplaces)
- Client's infrastructure cost: $800K/year
- Revenue captured: $0

**Lost Revenue:** $3M/year (at 7% marketplace fee)

### Finding 2: Cross-Platform Bot Networks

**Pattern:**
- Bot operators create accounts on both platforms
- Use creator tools to generate collections at scale
- Use marketplace to wash-trade and inflate volumes
- Each platform sees compliant behavior in isolation
- Combined pattern: Obvious manipulation

**Impact:**
- 340 bot accounts identified
- $18M in fake volume (distorts marketplace metrics)
- SEO and discovery pollution (legit creators buried)
- Reputational risk

---

### Finding 3: Creator Onboarding Leak

**Pattern:**
- 40% of marketplace power-users fit "creator profile"
- Zero outreach to convert them to creator platform
- Platforms don't share user data or signals

**Opportunity:**
- 180K qualified creator leads
- 8% conversion rate (benchmark)
- 14,400 new creators
- Average creator value: $1,200/year
- **Revenue opportunity:** $17M/year

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (0-30 days)
- Link creator and marketplace accounts (identity resolution)
- Detect fee avoidance patterns (flag for review)
- Ban bot networks operating across both platforms
- **Cost:** $200K | **ROI:** $3M/year

### Medium-term (30-90 days)
- Build creator→marketplace incentive program (fee discounts for using both)
- Deploy cross-platform marketing automation
- Unified fraud detection
- **Cost:** $600K | **ROI:** $17M/year

---

## Outcome

**Client Action:**
- Implemented identity linking in 21 days
- Banned 340 bot accounts (cleaned marketplace)
- Launched creator incentive program

**90-Day Results:**
- Recovered $750K in first quarter (fee avoidance reduction)
- 8,200 marketplace users converted to creators
- Bot volume down 89%

**ROI:** $85K → $8M Year 1 value (94x)

## Key Insight

Two platforms under one roof doesn't mean they're connected. Most companies operate silos **even within their own organization**.

Cross-platform analysis finds the money hiding in the gaps.
