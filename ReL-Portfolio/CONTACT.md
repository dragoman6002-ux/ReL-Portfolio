### "How quickly will you respond?"
- **Email:** 24 hours (weekdays)
- **LinkedIn/Twitter DM:** 24-48 hours
- **Emergency:** 4 hours
- **During engagement:** Same day

### "Do you answer questions before engagement?"
Yes, within reason. Initial call is free, and we'll answer general questions via email. For detailed architecture discussions, we typically need to be under NDA.

### "Can we meet in person?"
Yes, if you're Miami-based or we're traveling to your city. Initial calls are typically video, but happy to meet in person for final delivery or kickoff.

### "What if we're in a different time zone?"
We accommodate all time zones for initial calls and engagements. Most clients are US-based, but we've worked with EMEA and APAC companies.

### "Do you respond on weekends?"
Not typically, unless you're an active engagement with an emergency. Weekday response times are reliable.
