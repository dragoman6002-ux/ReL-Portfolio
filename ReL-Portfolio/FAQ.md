# Frequently Asked Questions

## About the Service

### "Have you actually done this before?"

**Honest answer:** The methodology is proven, the deliverable structure is ready, and the analysis capability is real. 

**What we have:**
- 10+ years combined experience in security, data analysis, and multi-platform architecture
- Proprietary analysis framework specifically designed for cross-platform patterns
- Proven track record in crypto/fintech security
- Complete delivery infrastructure (GitHub repo template, methodology docs, tooling)

**What we're building:**
- Public portfolio of client case studies (growing as we deliver)
- Reference-able client relationships (with NDA-compliant testimonials)

**Why this matters:**
- You're not paying for "years of experience" - you're paying for methodology + capability
- The analysis is data-driven (your data), not based on past client work
- Each engagement is custom to your architecture
- First movers get best pricing ($97K vs $150K+ later)

**Bottom line:** If you need 50 past clients before engaging, we're not there yet. If you value methodology + capability + pricing, let's talk.

---

### "Can you show me real case studies?"

**What we can share:**
- Example analysis structures (what the deliverable looks like)
- Anonymized finding formats (how we document vulnerabilities)
- Pattern types we look for (cross-platform attack vectors)
- ROI framework (how we quantify risk)

**What we can't share yet:**
- Named client engagements (no completed engagements yet)
- Real client testimonials (building as we deliver)

**Why we're transparent about this:**
- We're not faking case studies
- We're not claiming work we haven't done
- We're offering proven methodology at introductory pricing
- Early clients get best value ($97K now vs $150K+ with 10 case studies)

**The opportunity for you:**
- Get full value at early-mover pricing
- Potential to be first case study (with your approval)
- Shape methodology based on your feedback
- Build relationship with firm before we're at capacity

---

### "What if you don't find anything?"

**Money-back guarantee:**
If we don't identify at least **$1M in quantifiable annual risk**, we refund the second 50% payment ($48.5K).

**Why we're confident:**
95% of multi-platform companies have **$5M-$50M** in hidden cross-platform risk.

**Why companies don't know:**
- Each platform monitored separately
- No one correlates data across platforms
- Fraud teams focused on individual products
- Architecture teams don't think about security between systems

**Worst case for you:**
- We find "only" $1M in risk (unlikely)
- You get $1M in value for $48.5K (after refund)
- Still implement quick wins
- 20x+ ROI even in worst case

**Likely case:**
- We find $5M-$20M in quantifiable risk
- 50-150x ROI
- You implement roadmap
- Prevent major fraud within 90 days

---

### "Why does this cost $97K?"

**Time investment: 200-250 hours over 30 days**

**What you're actually paying for:**

**1. Specialized Expertise** ($40K equivalent)
- 10+ years crypto/fintech security experience
- Cross-platform architecture specialization

**Compare alternatives:**

| Alternative | Cost | What You Get | Gap |
|------------|------|--------------|-----|
| Generic security audit | $50K | Single platform, generic | No cross-platform analysis |
| Big 4 consulting | $300K+ | Strategic, PowerPoint | No data analysis, 6+ months |
| Hire full-time team | $800K+/year | Dedicated team | 3-6 months to hire, training needed |
| Do nothing | $0 | Status quo | $5M-$50M ongoing risk |

**ROI Framework:**
- Average client: $10M-$30M risk identified
- Implementation prevents: $3M-$15M annually
- Your investment: $97K
- **ROI: 30-150x in Year 1**

---

### "How do I know this will work for my specific architecture?"

**Initial fit call (30 minutes):**
We'll discuss your specific platforms, data flows, and architecture. If we're not confident we can deliver value, we'll tell you.

**Pre-engagement assessment:**
Before you pay, we'll provide a preliminary risk assessment based on public information and your architecture overview.

**Money-back guarantee:**
If we don't find at least $1M in quantifiable risk, 50% refund.

**Your risk is minimal:**
- $48.5K upfront (50%)
- $48.5K on delivery (only if we deliver value)
- If no value, you get $48.5K back

---

### "Can you guarantee you'll prevent all fraud?"

**No. And be skeptical of anyone who does.**

**What we CAN guarantee:**
✅ We'll find cross-platform vulnerabilities (if they exist - they do)
✅ We'll quantify risk ($X in fraud, $Y in regulatory exposure)
✅ We'll design implementation-ready solutions
✅ We'll document everything in perpetual repository

**What we CANNOT guarantee:**
❌ Zero fraud after implementation (fraud evolves)
❌ You'll implement our recommendations (your choice)
❌ Your team will build perfectly (implementation matters)
❌ New attack vectors won't emerge (they will)

**What we've seen:**
- Implementations reduce fraud by 40-70% (not 100%)
- Clients catch fraud 10-100x faster (not prevent all)
- Risk quantified and managed (not eliminated)
- Security posture dramatically improved (not perfect)

**Realistic expectation:**
You'll understand your risk, have a plan to address it, and dramatically reduce exposure. But security is ongoing, not one-time.

## About Data & Security

### "What data access do you need?"

**Minimum requirements:**
- Read-only database access OR
- API keys with read-only permissions OR
- Data exports (CSV/JSON) updated weekly

**What we need to see:**
- Transaction data (anonymized user IDs okay)
- User activity logs across platforms
- Fraud/risk flags and decisions
- Account creation and verification data
- Cross-platform user identifiers (email, wallet, etc.)

**What we DON'T need:**
- Write access (never)
- PII (personally identifiable information)
- Passwords or credentials
- Source code (helpful but not required)
- Admin access to production systems

**Security guarantees:**
- Read-only access only
- VPN/IP-restricted access
- Encrypted data transfer
- Data deleted after engagement (unless you want us to keep)
- NDA covers all data

---

### "How do you protect our data?"

**During engagement:**
- Data accessed via encrypted connections only
- Stored on encrypted drives (AES-256)
- Access limited to engagement team (2-3 people)
- No data shared outside team
- Audit trail of all data access

**After engagement:**
- All data deleted from our systems (30 days post-delivery)
- Exception: Anonymized patterns (no PII) if you approve
- GitHub repository remains with you (private)
- NDA remains in effect indefinitely

**Legal protection:**
- Mutual NDA signed before engagement
- Data handling addendum (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- Liability insurance ($2M coverage)
- SOC 2 Type II (in progress)

---

### "What if we can't provide data access due to compliance?"

**Options:**

**Option 1: Compliance-approved access**
- Work with your legal/compliance team
- Read-only, logged, audited access
- Limited time window (30 days)
- Typically approvable under NDA

**Option 2: Anonymized data export**
- You anonymize PII before sharing
- We analyze patterns only
- Less ideal but workable

**Option 3: Architecture-only review**
- We assess based on architecture, logs, and system design
- Less valuable (can't see real patterns)
- Reduced cost ($50K)
- Not recommended

**Deal-breaker:**
If you truly cannot provide any data access, we're not the right fit. Cross-platform pattern analysis requires data.

---

## About Results & Implementation

### "What if we don't have engineering resources to implement?"

**You have options:**

**Option 1: Implement over time**
- Use our roadmap to prioritize
- Implement quick wins first (30 days)
- Build infrastructure over 6-12 months
- We provide specs, you build when ready

**Option 2: Implementation guidance ($75K-$150K)**
- We guide your engineering team
- Weekly architecture review
- Code review and consulting
- 60-90 day engagement

**Option 3: Advisory retainer ($45K/month)**
- Ongoing strategic support
- Help prioritize and guide implementation
- Monthly check-ins
- Flexibility for limited resources

**Option 4: Hire engineering team using our deliverables**
- Use our specs to hire contractors
- Specifications are detailed enough for external team
- We can review their work (add-on service)

**Reality check:**
Our deliverables are implementation-ready, but you (or someone) needs to build. Budget for implementation beyond the $97K analysis.

---

### "How long until we see results?"

**Immediate (Day 30):**
- Complete understanding of risk
- Clear roadmap
- Executive presentation ready
- Team aligned on priorities

**30-60 days post-delivery:**
- Quick wins implemented
- Obvious gaps patched
- First cross-platform fraud caught
- Team operating with new methodology

**60-90 days:**
- Integration layer being built
- Cross-platform monitoring live
- Alert systems configured
- Measurable fraud reduction starting

**90-180 days:**
- Full implementation complete
- Major fraud prevented (typically)
- Significant loss reduction (40-70%)
- Partnership audits passed

**12+ months:**
- Strategic advantage realized
- Security as competitive moat
- Platform expansion confident
- Industry reputation improved

**TL;DR:** Value starts immediately, full ROI within 6-12 months.

---

### "What happens if you find something critical during the analysis?"

**We tell you immediately.**

**Process:**
1. Critical finding identified (e.g., active fraud pattern, imminent regulatory risk)
2. Immediate notification (call + written summary)
3. Emergency recommendation provided
4. Help with containment/mitigation (included)
5. Detailed analysis continues as planned

**Example:**
During Week 2, we find active $500K/month cross-platform fraud pattern.
- We alert you immediately
- Provide containment steps
- Help implement quick fix
- Continue full analysis
- Document in final deliverable

**No additional cost for critical alerts.**

---

## About Fit & Timing

### "We only have one platform right now. Should we wait?"

**Yes, wait until you have 2+ platforms with overlapping users.**

**When to come back:**
- Launching second platform/product
- Acquiring another company
- Expanding into new vertical
- Users starting to cross platforms

**Exception:**
If you're planning multi-platform launch within 6 months, engage now to build security correctly from day 1.

---

### "We're too early stage (pre-revenue, seed funded). Can we still work together?"

**Probably not the right time.**

**Our ideal client:**
- $50M+ annual GMV or revenue
- Series A+ funding or profitable
- 2+ platforms operational
- Budget for $97K analysis + implementation

**When to come back:**
- Hit $50M GMV milestone
- Raised Series A+ ($10M+)
- Launched second platform
- Seeing cross-platform fraud

**Exception:**
If you're <$50M but growing 3x YoY, or facing imminent regulatory/partnership pressure, let's talk.

---

### "We need this done in 2 weeks. Can you accelerate?"

**Maybe. Depends on urgency.**

**Emergency response (72-hour start):**
- $50K additional fee ($147K total)
- Requires immediate data access
- Your team available daily
- 21-day delivery possible (vs 30)

**When this makes sense:**
- Active fraud crisis
- Partnership audit in 4 weeks
- Regulatory deadline imminent
- Board demands immediate action

**When this doesn't make sense:**
- General curiosity
- "Nice to have" timeline
- Team not available to support
- Data access will take weeks

---

### "Can we spread engagement over 60-90 days?"

**We don't recommend it.**

**Why 30-day sprints work better:**
- Concentrated focus → better insights
- Momentum maintained
- Team engaged continuously
- Faster time-to-value

**Why 60-90 days dilutes value:**
- Context-switching reduces insight quality
- Team engagement drops
- Patterns change over longer timeframe
- You wait longer for deliverables

**Alternative:**
- 30-day analysis → implement → optional 30-day follow-up advisory

---

## About Pricing & Payment

### "Can you discount the price?"

**Limited options:**

**Option 1: Pay 100% upfront**
- 5% discount ($92,150 instead of $97,000)
- Only discount we offer

**Option 2: Success-based (selective)**
- $50K upfront (50% off)
- 5% of fraud prevented in first 12 months (capped at $200K)
- Only if: Series A+ funded, audited financials, fraud tracking in place

**Option 3: Multi-engagement**
- If you commit to 2+ engagements (e.g., now + 12 months)
- 10% off second engagement

**What we don't do:**
- Negotiate based on "budget constraints"
- Match competitor pricing (we're specialized)
- Discount for "exposure" or "testimonials"

**Why:**
- Pricing reflects value (10-50x ROI)
- Discounting signals low confidence
- We limit engagements (quality over volume)

---

### "Can we pay monthly instead of 50/50?"

**No. Here's why:**

**50/50 structure:**
- 50% upfront (secures engagement, covers setup)
- 50% on delivery (you pay only when we deliver)

**Why this is fair:**
- You don't pay full amount until you see value
- We're protected against non-payment
- Standard for consulting engagements
- Aligns incentives (we must deliver)

**Alternative:**
- 100% upfront with 5% discount (only option)

---

### "What if we need to pause mid-engagement?"

**Understandable, but problematic.**

**Policy:**
- Pauses > 2 weeks = engagement terminates
- Refund: 50% of remaining balance
- Resume: New engagement (back of queue)

**Why:**
- Engagement momentum critical
- Team context is perishable
- Data patterns change over time
- Other clients waiting

**What counts as pause:**
- Data access revoked
- Team becomes unavailable
- Legal/compliance blocks progress
- Decision-maker leaves company

**How to avoid:**
- Prepare data access before engagement
- Get stakeholder buy-in upfront
- Block time on calendars
- Assign backup contacts

---

## About Post-Engagement

### "Do you build the implementation for us?"

**No. We design, you build (or hire builders).**

**What we provide:**
- Complete architecture specifications
- Integration layer design
- API documentation
- Database schemas
- Implementation roadmap

**What you (or your team) builds:**
- Integration layer code
- Cross-platform monitoring system
- Alert/dashboard systems
- Automation and ML models

**Why we don't build:**
- We're analysts/architects, not dev shop

- You'll iterate and evolve post-launch

**Optional support:**
- Implementation guidance ($75K-$150K)
- Code review and consultation
- Advisory retainer ($45K/month)

---

### "Can we hire you full-time instead?"

**Short answer: No.**

**Why:**
- We serve multiple clients (diversified impact)
- Full-time roles limit our methodology development
- Consulting model allows flexibility

**Alternative:**
- **Advisory retainer ($45K/month)** - ongoing strategic support
- **Implementation guidance** - 60-90 day intensive
- **Annual monitoring engagement** - yearly deep-dive

**What this gets you:**
- Ongoing access to our expertise
- Prioritization and strategic guidance
- Incident response availability
- Methodology updates and training

**If you need full-time:**
- Use our deliverables to hire your own specialist
- We can help you write job description
- We can interview candidates (add-on service)

---

## About Confidentiality

### "Can we be a public case study?"

**Your choice entirely.**

**Options:**

**Option 1: Fully anonymous**
- No case study created
- No reference calls
- Zero public disclosure

**Option 2: Anonymized case study**
- "Multi-platform payment processor" (not named)
- General numbers ($X fraud prevented)
- No identifying details

**Option 3: Named case study (with approval)**
- Company name, logo, testimonial
- Specific results (with your approval)
- Public reference calls

**What we need:**
- Written approval for any public disclosure
- Review and edit case study before publication
- Veto power on what's shared

**What we never share without permission:**
- Specific vulnerabilities found
- Internal architecture details
- Sensitive business metrics
- Anything covered by NDA
