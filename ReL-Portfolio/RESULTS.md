## What Changes Operationally

### Before ReL Analysis
❌ **Siloed monitoring** - Each platform watches itself
❌ **Delayed detection** - Fraud discovered after spreading
❌ **Manual correlation** - Security team stitching together alerts
❌ **Unknown exposure** - "We have some risk, not sure how much"
❌ **Reactive response** - Fight fires as they happen

### After ReL Analysis
✅ **Unified visibility** - See patterns across all platforms
✅ **Real-time detection** - Catch fraud as it crosses platforms
✅ **Automated correlation** - System flags cross-platform patterns
✅ **Quantified exposure** - "$X in annual fraud, $Y in regulatory risk"
✅ **Proactive prevention** - Stop attacks before they scale

## Anti-Results: What This Doesn't Do

### We Don't:
❌ **Guarantee zero fraud** - No one can, fraud evolves
❌ **Build your systems** - We design specs, you build (or we guide)
❌ **Provide ongoing monitoring** - We show you how, you operate (or advisory)
❌ **Replace your security team** - We augment and upskill them
❌ **Fix everything in 30 days** - We identify and prioritize, you implement

### What This Means:
- You get **knowledge and roadmap**, not a turnkey solution
- Your team **gains capability**, they don't become dependent
- Investment is **strategic**, not operational
- Results **compound over time** as you implement

> **— VP Operations, Payment Processor ($240M GMV)**

> "The partnership audit would have killed our biggest revenue channel. ReL's analysis gave us exactly what we needed to pass. $97K saved us $180M in partnership revenue."
> **— CISO, Multi-Platform Crypto Company**

> "Not just finding vulnerabilities - they showed us how to think about cross-platform security systematically. That methodology is now core to how we build."
> **— CTO, Series C Fintech ($480M valuation)**

- Get architectural guidance
- Build foundation for future

**Best case** (20% of engagements):
- Find $20M-$100M+ in exposure
- Prevent major incident within 90 days
