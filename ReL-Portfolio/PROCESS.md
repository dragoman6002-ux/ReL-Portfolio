## Questions About Process?

**"Can we go faster than 30 days?"**
- Yes, if urgency warrants (partnership audit, regulatory deadline)
- May cost more ($120K-$150K for 21-day sprint)
- Requires immediate data access and team availability

**"Can we spread it over 60 days?"**
- Generally no - dilutes focus and momentum
- Better to do 30-day intensive, pause, implement, then optional advisory

**"What if we can't provide data access?"**
- Deal-breaker for most engagements
- We need real data to find real patterns
- Architecture-only review possible ($50K, less valuable)

**"Can we start immediately?"**
- Typically 2-3 weeks wait (we limit concurrent engagements)
- Emergency response available (72-hour start, $50K premium)
