## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Security Audit
- ❌ Point-in-time assessment
- ❌ Theoretical vulnerabilities
- ❌ Generic recommendations
- ❌ PDF report that sits on a shelf

### ReL Cross-Platform Analysis
- ✅ Continuous insight access
- ✅ Real pattern analysis from YOUR data
- ✅ Specific, quantified findings
- ✅ Implementable architecture specs
- ✅ Living repository you can reference forever

## Real Example: What One Client Got

**Multi-Platform Payment Processor** (Name withheld under NDA)

**Delivered:**
- 127 documented cross-platform vulnerabilities
- $112M in quantified annual risk exposure
- 34-page executive report with board presentation
- Integration architecture for 3 platforms
- 180-day implementation roadmap
- JSON database of 2,847 suspicious patterns

**Their Result:**
- Prevented $15M fraud incident (within 60 days of implementation)
- Passed PayPal partnership security audit
- Reduced fraud losses by 68% in first 6 months
- Built competitive moat (competitors don't have this)

**What They Still Use:**
- Cross-platform monitoring system (built from our specs)
- Weekly pattern review process
- Integration architecture (expanded to 5 platforms)
- Our repository as training material for new security hires

---

## Comparison: What You DON'T Get

We're not:
- ❌ A penetration testing firm
- ❌ A compliance checklist service
- ❌ A general security audit
- ❌ A consulting retainer with hourly billing

We specifically find **cross-platform patterns** that create **quantifiable business risk** and deliver **implementable solutions**.

If you need traditional security testing, we're not the right fit.

If you need to understand what's happening BETWEEN your platforms and what it's costing you, we're exactly right.
