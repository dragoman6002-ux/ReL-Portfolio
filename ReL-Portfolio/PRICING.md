## ROI Framework: Why This Pays For Itself

### Average Client ROI: 10-50x in Year 1

**Let's break down the math:**

### Example 1: Payment Processor ($100M GMV)
**Investment:** $97,000

**Prevented Losses (Year 1):**
- Cross-platform fraud: $5M/year → prevent 60% = **$3M saved**
- Regulatory fines (avoided): $10M potential → **$10M risk eliminated**
- Partnership revenue protected: $50M at risk → **$50M secured**

**Quantifiable Return:** 
- Conservative: $3M fraud prevention = **31x ROI**
- With risk avoidance: $13M total value = **134x ROI**

---

### Example 2: NFT Marketplace ($200M GMV)
**Investment:** $120,000 (complex engagement)

**Prevented Losses (Year 1):**
- Account takeover fraud: $2M/year → prevent 70% = **$1.4M saved**
- Money laundering (undetected): $8M/year → catch 30% = **$2.4M recovered**
- Brand protection: 1 major incident avoided = **$5M+ value**

**Quantifiable Return:**
- Conservative: $3.8M direct savings = **32x ROI**
- With brand protection: $9M+ total value = **75x ROI**

---

### Example 3: Multi-Platform Fintech ($500M GMV)
**Investment:** $150,000 (enterprise custom)

**Prevented Losses (Year 1):**
- Cross-platform fraud: $15M/year → prevent 40% = **$6M saved**
- Regulatory compliance: Avoided FinCEN audit escalation = **$20M+ risk**
- Partnership audit: Passed PayPal security review = **$100M revenue protected**

**Quantifiable Return:**
- Conservative: $6M fraud prevention = **40x ROI**
- With compliance & partnerships: $26M+ value = **173x ROI**
