# Industries We Serve

## Primary Focus: Multi-Platform Crypto & Fintech

We specialize in companies operating **multiple platforms or products** where user behavior spans systems and creates security blind spots.

## 1. Crypto Payment Processors

### Typical Architecture:
- Consumer onramp/offramp platform
- Merchant payment processing

- Wallet infrastructure

### Common Cross-Platform Risks:
- **Graduated Fraudster:** Banned consumer becomes merchant
- **Money Laundering:** Fiat onramp → merchant → crypto offramp
- **Account Takeover:** Compromised credentials across platforms
- **Regulatory Gap:** KYC on one platform, not enforced on others

### Example Companies:
- MoonPay (Consumer + Helio merchants + Iron enterprise)
- Stripe Crypto (Payments + Bridge acquisition)
- Coinbase (Exchange + Commerce + Wallet)
- Circle (USDC + payments + infrastructure)

### Typical ROI: $5M-$50M fraud prevention + $20M-$100M regulatory risk mitigation

## 2. NFT Marketplaces & Gaming

### Typical Architecture:
- Primary marketplace platform
- Creator/artist platform
- Wallet/custody service
- Secondary market or game integrations

### Common Cross-Platform Risks:
