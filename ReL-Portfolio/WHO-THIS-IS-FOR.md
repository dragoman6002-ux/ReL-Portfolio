## Specific Profiles That Benefit Most

### 1. Multi-Platform Crypto Companies
**Example:** Payment processor + NFT marketplace + DeFi protocol

**Why You Need This:**
- Users can be banned on one platform, create accounts on another
- Money laundering patterns span platforms
- Regulatory scrutiny increasing (FinCEN, EU MiCA)
- Partnership audits (PayPal, Visa, etc.) asking about cross-platform monitoring

**Typical Exposure:** $5M-$50M/year in preventable fraud + regulatory risk

---

### 2. FinTech Ecosystem Players
**Example:** Consumer app + merchant platform + enterprise solution

**Why You Need This:**
- Account takeover can span products
- Fraudulent merchants start as consumers
- Cross-product money movement creates blind spots
- Brand risk if one product's fraud affects another

**Typical Exposure:** $10M-$100M/year in fraud + brand risk

---

### 3. E-Commerce Multi-Vertical Operators
**Example:** Marketplace + fulfillment + financial services

**Why You Need This:**
- Sellers can exploit gaps between platforms
- Payment fraud patterns cross systems
- Inventory/fulfillment fraud linked to payment patterns
- Customer trust depends on security across all touchpoints

**Typical Exposure:** $5M-$30M/year in fraud + customer churn risk

---

### 4. Gaming/Entertainment Platforms
**Example:** Multiple game titles + marketplace + payment system

**Why You Need This:**
- Account sellers exploit verification gaps
- Fraud patterns span titles
- Payment abuse crosses gaming platforms
- Virtual goods fraud correlates with payment fraud

**Typical Exposure:** $2M-$20M/year in fraud + reputation risk

## Red Flags: This Might NOT Be For You

### ❌ Single Platform Operation
**Why:** Our value is finding patterns BETWEEN systems. If you only have one platform, traditional security audits are better.

**Alternative:** Consider us when you launch your second product/platform.

---

### ❌ Can't Provide Data Access
**Why:** We need to analyze actual transaction patterns, not just architecture diagrams.

**Alternative:** If data access is impossible (regulatory, technical, political), we're not the right fit.

---

### ❌ Under $50M Annual GMV
**Why:** Our findings are valuable at scale. Below $50M, the investment may not justify the ROI.

**Alternative:** Come back when you've scaled to where patterns matter.

**Exception:** If you're <$50M but growing fast (3x year-over-year) or facing imminent regulatory scrutiny, let's talk.

---

### ❌ Looking for Compliance Checkbox
**Why:** We're not a SOC 2 audit or ISO certification service. We find hidden business risk, not compliance documentation.

**Alternative:** Hire a compliance auditor first, then come to us for cross-platform risk.

---

### ❌ Can't Invest $85K-$120K
**Why:** This is not a $5K security scan. It's a 30-day dedicated analysis by specialists who understand multi-platform architecture.

**Alternative:** Wait until you have budget, OR until a fraud incident justifies the investment (but that's expensive).

## The Decision-Maker Profile

You're probably the right person to talk to if you're:

### Primary Decision-Makers:
- **CEO/Founder** (Multi-product companies)
- **Chief Security Officer** (CISO)
- **Chief Risk Officer** (CRO)
- **VP of Operations** (Platform operators)
- **Chief Technology Officer** (CTO) (Architecture-focused)

### Common Trigger Events:
- Just launched second/third platform
- Recent fraud incident that spanned products
- Partnership audit revealed integration gaps
- Regulatory inquiry about cross-platform monitoring
- Competitor got hit with multi-platform fraud
- Board asked "How do we monitor across platforms?"

---

## Geographic Focus

### Primary: North America
- **Miami, FL** - crypto/fintech hub
- **San Francisco** - tech companies
- **New York** - fintech/payments
- **Austin** - fast-growing tech scene

### Secondary: Global (English-speaking)
- **London** - EU crypto/fintech
- **Singapore** - APAC crypto hub
- **Toronto** - Canadian fintech

**Why Geography Matters:** In-person kickoff preferred (not required), timezone overlap for communication, regulatory context understanding.

---

## Company Stage

### Ideal Stage: Growth to Scale-Up
- **Series A to Series C** funded
- **OR** Bootstrapped with $10M+ revenue
- **OR** Enterprise with 2+ product lines

### Too Early:
- Pre-revenue
- Single product
- <$5M funding or revenue

### Too Late:
- Established enterprises with full security operations centers
- Already have cross-platform monitoring built
- **Exception:** If you've built monitoring but still seeing gaps, we can audit your system
