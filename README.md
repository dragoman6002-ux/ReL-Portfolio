# Cross-Platform Security & Revenue Intelligence

Temporal correlation analysis for crypto payment companies.

I find security gaps and revenue opportunities that exist **between** your platforms—the blind spots that single-platform analytics miss.

---

## Current Client Profile

**Industries:**
- Crypto payment processors
- NFT marketplaces
- DeFi platforms
- Enterprise stablecoin infrastructure

**Problem I Solve:**

You have multiple platforms (consumer app, merchant platform, enterprise tools). Each has its own analytics and security. But nobody is looking at what happens **between** them.

That's where the money is:
- **Security:** Fraud that starts on Platform A and migrates to Platform B
- **Revenue:** User behaviors that span platforms (hidden opportunities)
- **Operations:** Integration failures that cost you money

## Selected Work (Anonymized)

### Case Study 1: Multi-Platform Payment Processor
**Client Profile:** $2B+ crypto payment company, 30M+ users, 3 separate platforms

**Problem:** Suspected cross-platform fraud but no way to detect it

**Findings:**
- Identified $12M/year in preventable fraud crossing platforms
- Found $8M revenue opportunity from cross-platform user patterns
- Detected 3 major regulatory compliance gaps (pre-audit)

**Outcome:** Client building integration layer based on analysis. Avoided $50M+ regulatory risk.

**Engagement:** 30 days, $97K

---

### Case Study 2: Enterprise Stablecoin Platform
**Client Profile:** Large-cap crypto company expanding into B2B

**Problem:** Consumer and enterprise platforms completely siloed

**Findings:**
- Security controls designed for consumer use (not enterprise)
- 40% of enterprise users started as consumers (invisible to enterprise team)
- $5M opportunity from better onboarding for consumer→enterprise migration

**Outcome:** Redesigned security architecture. Launched enterprise upsell program.

**Engagement:** 45 days, $120K

---

### Case Study 3: NFT Marketplace + Creator Tools
**Client Profile:** Top-10 NFT platform with separate creator tools

**Problem:** Fraud in creator tools, revenue leak between platforms

**Findings:**
- Creators using platform A to mint, platform B to sell (avoiding fees)
- $3M/year in lost revenue from cross-platform arbitrage
- Bot networks operating across both platforms undetected

**Outcome:** Built unified identity layer. Recovered $2M in first quarter.

**Engagement:** 30 days, $85K

## What I Don't Do

I'm **not** a dashboard builder. I'm not going to help you organize data within a single platform.

If you need better charts, hire a BI team.

If you need metric trees, use Count or Looker.

**I find the patterns your existing tools can't see** because they require looking across disconnected systems.

---

## Methodology (High-Level)

**What is ReL?**

Relational Emergence Language—a proprietary approach to detecting temporal correlations across platforms that don't natively communicate.

**How it works:**
1. Ingest event streams from multiple platforms (read-only access)
2. Build temporal correlation graph across platform boundaries
3. Detect patterns that span systems (security threats, user behaviors, integration failures)
4. Quantify business impact (dollars, not theory)
5. Design integration architecture to address gaps

**What's different:**

Traditional analytics: "What happened on Platform A?"  
Cross-platform analytics: "What happened on A **that's connected to** B?"

Most fraud detection: "Detect bad actors on this platform."  
Cross-platform fraud detection: "Detect actors who are bad **across multiple** platforms."

The methodology is proprietary (patent-pending, trade secret). You get the **results**, not the code.

## Typical Engagement

**Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1)**
- Map your platforms and data sources
- Identify integration gaps
- Set up read-only data access

**Phase 2: Analysis (Weeks 2-3)**
- Run temporal correlation analysis
- Identify cross-platform patterns
- Quantify business impact

**Phase 3: Delivery (Week 4)**
- Complete findings report
- Architecture specifications for fixes
- Implementation roadmap

**Deliverables:**
- Private GitHub repo with all findings (you own everything)
- Quantified security gaps ($ values)
- Revenue opportunities ($ values)
- Integration architecture design
- Implementation roadmap

**Your investment:** $85K-$120K depending on complexity  
**Typical ROI:** $10M-$50M in Year 1 (fraud reduction + risk mitigation + revenue capture)

---

## Who This Is For

**Good fit:**
- You have 2+ platforms (consumer, merchant, enterprise, etc.)
- Platforms are somewhat siloed (separate teams, separate data)
- You're scaling fast (fraud and revenue leaks are growing)
- You have upcoming compliance requirements or partner audits
- You suspect there's money on the table but can't see it

**Not a good fit:**
- Single platform (hire a BI team instead)
- You want dashboards (use Looker, Count, Tableau)
- You're pre-revenue (not enough data to analyze)
- You're not willing to grant read-only data access
